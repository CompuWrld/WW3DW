To have standards for the future of the web
The license is just to protect me at first. 
I plan on releasing this project under no license

I have thought about this for many years, I think it is a good idea to make web standards 
for the future of the web.

I want to create a furure of the web standards, similar to how RFCs have shaped the modern web

I have a vision for the future of the World Wide Web, this may or may not be successful.

I intend this to be a place where we can create and share protocols, design standards, etc...

**Create the first World Wide 3D Web browser**
